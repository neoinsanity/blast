  Ah yes, the first blog. The one were the angst of a topic and stress of layout and presentation
  collide. Procrastination found ready allies to ensure some wasted hours. It can be amazing how
  much time can pass while flipping back and forth in edit and preview mode. Background change,
  font change, background color change, font color change, ... rinse and repeat.
  <p/>
  The realization that presentation fiddling would be easier if there was an actual blog post with
  a good amount of content and content variety finally interrupted all the false starts. A spoonful
  of sugar helps the medicine got down, and for this blog that sugar was code syntax highlighting.
  While it would be simple enough to place code samples in an html block that would preserve the
  code format, it would be much more elegant to have actual code syntax highlighting.
  <p/>
  To that end, a little web searching led to a fairly simple solution. The solution was to utilize
  <a href="http://alexgorbatchev.com/SyntaxHighlighter/">SyntaxHighlighter</a>, which is quite
  ubiquitous and easy to use. SyntaxHighlighter is a a javascript library that is self contained.
  It is open source and can be found at
  <a href="https://github.com/alexgorbatchev/syntaxhighlighter">alexgorbatchev/syntaxhighlighter</a>.
  There is plenty of material on how SyntaxHighlighter is used and installed in a variety of
  environments. For instructions on how to install SyntaxHighlighter for use on Blogger/Blogspt can
  be found
  <a href="http://www.stramaxon.com/2012/07/add-syntax-highlighter-to-blogger.html">here</a>.

  <h2>Is this meta?</h2>
  SyntaxHighlighter has a wonderful array of languages that it supports. It is easy enough to
  lookup the full range of supported languages, Just take a step through the javascript, or take
  a look at the online documentation.
  <p/>
  For the purposes of filling up a page to get this blog started, a couple of example uses of
  Syntaxhighlighters attribute flags will be demonstrated.
  <p/>

  <h3>HTML/XML</h3>
  The first example is how to get XML/HTML syntax highlighting. This is necessary to learn to get
  demonstrate the html syntax to highlighting examples in other languages. Here's the example of
  how to insert html sample code:
    <pre class="brush: xml">
      &lt;html&gt;
        &lt;body&gt;
          <h1>Hola! Mundo</h1>
        &lt;/body&gt;
      &lt;/html&gt;
    </pre>
  You will need to add the following highlight to your page.
    <pre class="brush: xml">
        &lt;pre class="brush: xml"&gt;
          &amp;lt;html&amp;gt;
            &amp;lt;body&amp;gt;
              <h1>Hola! Mundo</h1>
            &amp;lt;/body&amp;gt;
          &amp;lt;/html&amp;gt;
        &lt;/pre&gt;
    </pre>
  Keep in mind that to get the HTML, BODY, and PRE tags to show up in code examples. the use of the
  ampersand directive is necessary.
  <p/>
</div>
<div>
  While it is simple enough to do plain text in a simple &lt;block-quote&gt;, SyntaxHighlighter
  gives nice line numbers. And the line numbers can be adjusted by setting a first-line property.
    <pre class="brush: xml">
        &lt;pre class="brush: plain first-line: 42"&gt;
            Hola! Mundo
        &lt;/pre&gt;
    </pre>
  Which leads to:
    <pre class="brush: plain first-line: 42">
        Hola! Mundo
    </pre>
  <p/>
</div>
<div>
  It is also possible to set a title for a code sample by utilizing the title directive.
    <pre class="brush: xml">
        &lt;pre class="brush: bash title: 'Sample Bash'"&gt;
            #!/usr/bin/env bash
            echo "Hola Mundo"
        &lt;/pre&gt;
    </pre>
  Resulting in;
    <pre class="brush: bash title: 'Sample Bash'">
        #!/usr/bin/env bash
        echo "Hola Mundo"
    </pre>
  <p/>
</div>
<div>
  To highlight individual lines, which can be useful when there is a desire for
  emphasis.
    <pre class="brush: xml">
        &lt;pre class="brush: js highlight: [2,5]"&gt;
        /*
        Hola Mundo Function
        */
        function HolaMundo(dude: "Mundo"){
          console.log('Hola! %s', dude);
        }
        &lt;/pre&gt;
    </pre>
  Producting;
    <pre class="brush: js highlight: [2,5]">
    /*
    Hola Mundo Function
    */
    function HolaMundo(dude: "Mundo"){
      console.log('Hola! %s', dude);
    }
    </pre>
  <p/>
</div>
<div>
  In those cases where code samples may be large, it would be desirable to have the sample start
  off collapsed.
    <pre class="brush: xml">
        &lt;pre class="brush: css collapse: true"&gt;
            #header {
                padding-top: 15px;
                border-radius: inherit;
            }
        &lt;/pre&gt;
    </pre>
  Leading to this collapse code sample.
    <pre class="brush: css toolbar: true collapse: true">
        #header {
            padding-top: 15px;
            border-radius: inherit;
        }
    </pre>
  <p/>
</div>
<div>
  If the desire is to have a toolbar for the given code snippet, utilize the toolbar directive.
    <pre class="brush: xml">
        &lt;pre class="brush: python toolbar: true"&gt;
        """A Class to greet the world"""
        class HolaMundo(object):

            def __init__(self, dude='Mundo'):
                self._dude = dude

            def grito(self):
                print 'Hola!', self.dude
        &lt;/pre&gt;
    </pre>
  Which removes the toolbar as shown below;
    <pre class="brush: python toolbar: true">
    """A Class to greet the world"""
    class HolaMundo(object):

        def __init__(self, dude='Mundo'):
            self._dude = dude

        def grito(self):
            print 'Hola!', self.dude
    </pre>
  <p/>
</div>
<div>
  Sometime the use of gutters is not desired for a code sample. These can be disabled utilizing
  the gutter directive.
    <pre class="brush: xml">
        &lt;pre class="brush: sql gutter: false"&gt;
            select * 
            from Mundo 
            where name = "Mundo";
        &lt;/pre&gt;
    </pre>
    <pre class="brush: sql gutter: false">
        select * 
        from Mundo 
        where name = "Mundo";
    </pre>
  <p/>
</div>
<div>
  All of these directive can be mixed and matched.
</div>
