      Ah yes, the first blog. The one were the angst of a topic and stress of
      layout and presentation collide. Procrastination found ready allies to
      ensure some wasted hours. It can be amazing how much time can pass while
      flipping back and forth in edit and preview mode. Background change, font
      change, background color change, font color change, ... rinse and
      repeat.</br>
      The realization that presentation fiddling would be easier if there was an
      actual blog post with a good amount of content and content variety,
      finally interrupted all the false starts. A spoonful of sugar helps the
      medicine got down, and for this blog that sugar was code syntax
      highlighting. Fairly obvious considering that this is a blog about
      enthusiasm over writing code.</br>
